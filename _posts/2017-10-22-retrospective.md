It's been roughly a year since I started DJing at
[Hollow Earth Radio](http://www.hollowearthradio.org/) and I think it would be
interesting to go back and see how I got to now from then. It's a little more
interesting now than it would be at the end of the year when people normally
do these kinds of things, because then it will just be trite and boring because
everyone is doing it. Now, I have no such excuse. It'll only be trite and boring
as a result of my own triteness and boringness.

And I am a very boring person.

I started off with *How Do You Live?*, a show devoted exclusively to music and
spoken word which appropriated other musics and words. Except I didn't call it
"appropriation" as that's a loaded word which doesn't quite reflect what's going
on in the pieces I played. I avoided playing anything that I felt disrespected
those who I felt weren't due disrespect. Same with heavily commercialized
artists who make bank and their names off of an art based on sharing and
cross-communication. So I called it "expropriation" instead. I thought that was
better. Now, I'm not entirely sure, but, there it was.

A lot of my plans for that show failed. I thought that in-house collages might
be a thing. They weren't. I also hoped for local artists to send in works. That
didn't happen. Plans were made for people to call in to the show live and
contribute to the mix of sounds. I couldn't wrap my head around how the phone
lines were set up -- just as well, because I lived in fear of anyone calling
in. And I had so few listeners that there was no point in trying to gear up for
that anyway.

Despite all that, I think the show had a good run. It lasted for twelve shows
-- right at three months -- and about half of them I think were solid and stand
up to scrutiny. Well, four of them, in any case. I think my personal favorites
are the [Retrofuturism Retrospective](https://www.mixcloud.com/djleterrassier/how-do-you-live-xi-copy-20170321/)
and the [final show](https://www.mixcloud.com/djleterrassier/how-do-you-live-xii-leave-the-capitol-20170328/).

The format for *How Do You Live?* felt a little too constraining after a while
-- or maybe constraints are only fun if they're temporary -- so the sun set on
that and I went adrift without a proper show name for a while. Somewhere in
there, I also moved from late nights to late mornings. The format was best
described as "whatever I feel like." In fact, I'm not quite remembering many of
the shows I did. The one I do remember is probably the best one -- certainly the
only one I've archived publically -- is the [two hour anarcho-punk show](https://www.mixcloud.com/djleterrassier/unnamed-interim-show-v-prisoners-of-pain-and-power-in-every-state-20170502/).
I'm sure I missed a few essential bands and artists, but I think it was a good
sounding set.

I finally found a show name that fit. Unfortunately, I realized a few months
later that it was the name of a show from another radio station that roughly
had the same theme and one that I had listened to before. So, so embarrassing.
Thematically, it was more conceptual -- shows focused on an idea and building up
from there. I remember a fun one where I played the audio from a number of
unboxing videos -- all with the name brands diligently bleeped out by hand. I
finally did do a collage set of, again, audio from videos -- this time, from
some guy hiking in, usually, a forest. That was kinda interesting. Or, I'd
select a theme and find a bunch of songs that fit the theme. Notoriously, I once
[rolled a set of d20 dice and read the results live on the air for an hour](https://www.mixcloud.com/djleterrassier/nothing-special-xi-the-ethics-of-possibiliy-demonstrated-by-means-of-probabilities-20170808/).
Fun times.

I did end up switching the name again (*Smoke and Straight Lines*) -- and,
moving back to late nights once
Hollow Earth Radio went terrestrial, again (*Ruba'bolo*) -- and I'm currently
trying to refine
and solidify the format. I'd be surprised if I ever succeeded at that, but I
expect that I'll have a certain degree of fun trying.

I still expect no listeners.
